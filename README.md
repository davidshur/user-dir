# user-dir

Page where one can filter through users using a search bar!

## Installation

There is no installation, simply visit the live site on [Heroku](https://radiant-headland-39127.herokuapp.com/)

## Usage

This website is simple and easy to use. Just type into the search bar and the table will filter itself. The results are filtered by the query shown on the right. Click the dropdown to see more query options.

You may also select the button on the left to change whether the table is sorted by ascending or descending IDs.

## Credits

I used ReactJS, built with create-react-app. I also used Bootstrap to help my page look a little nicer than it was!
